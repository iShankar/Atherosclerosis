**Alu elements** are short repititive DNA sequences (~300 bp long) and represent the most abundant transposable elements (~1 million copies) that are dispersed throughout the human genome. They are also called selfish or parasitic genes because their only function is to self-reproduce. They are classified as SINEs (Short interspersed nuclear elements), a subclass of repititive DNA elements. Alu insertions play a role in a few inherited human diseases and in various forms of cancer. See [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alu_element). 

The Alu element has been a major source of new exons  during primate evolution [1]
