AGE (Advanced Glycation Endproducts) is a recent focus. [Glycation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycation), also called non-enzymatic glycosylation, results from bonding of glucose or fructose to a protein or lipid molecule. It is a haphazard process, not enzymatic, does not need ATP, and impairs functioning of proteins and lipids. Glycosylation, in contrast, is a functional enzyme-mediated ATP-based attachment of sugars to protein to define sites. Exogenous glycations and AGEs are formed when sugars are cooked with  proteins or fats, at higher temperatures or longer cooking. About 10% are absorbed by the body. Browned food (eg. French Fries) is evidence (they enhance flavors and add colors). Recent work shows that these products are important contributors to inflammation and disease. Endogenous glycation occurs in blood to a small part of the absorbed simple sugars (glucose, fructose, and galactose). Fructose has 10* glycation activity vs glucose. Glycation is the first step, through Amadori/Schiff base/Mallard reactions, which lead to AGEs. Some AGEs are benign. Others are implicated in age related diseases such as **cardiovascular diseases** (the endothelium, fibringogen, and collage are damaged), Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and peripheral neuropathy (myeline is impacted). Long-lived cells (nerve and brain cells), long-lasting proteins (crystallins of the eye), and DNA may accumulate much damage with aging. Retinal and beta cells are at high risk of damage. *Damage of glycation results in stiffening or weakening of the collagen in the blood vessel walls* leading to HT or aneurysm. RBCs are easily accessible for measurement of glycated HB. Measure HbA1c - the predominant form of glycated Hb.
