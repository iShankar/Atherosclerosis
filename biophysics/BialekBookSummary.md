Ref: Biophysics: Searching for Essentials by W. Bialek, 2012. More info in readme. These are preliminary notes. 

Chapter 3: Lessons, Problems, and Principles:
1. Photon counting in vision - eg of a real biological phenomenon that is reproducible and quantitative, as with physics experiments, under well defined experimental conditions to get the needed precision. the total rod current in the dark ~ 20 pA; response to a single photon ~ 1 pA; and continuous background noise ~ 0.1 pA, due to tiny modulations of the cell's biochemical activity. 
2. Performance of these biological systems is determined by the physics of the problem that the system has been selected to solve; Expose this with real-world extreme cases: respond to every individual photon, in the dark; and provide spatio-temporal discrimination - not an aggregate recognition. 
3. Properties of the system - and rationale behind them:  Single rods have nonlinear filters vs ganglion cells where spatio-temporal specificity will decide the level of aggregate behavior of summation before application of the sigmoid; In the brain, one can find neighboring cells that are broadly of the same type but have made slightly different choices about almost all the relevant parameters; There may be many different combinations of microscopic parameters that lead to the same phenomenological parameters - but this casts doubt on 'one explanation'; Rods - with individual nonlinearity and filter characteristics - yield near-optimal performance. Evolution has selected the best solution to to a problem that is essential to the life of the organism. This does not tell how the optimum was reached, but can predict the observable behavior of the system; There are many objections to the previous ('inductive'?) approach. This is known - there are many different ideas in theoretical physics that can be formulated as variational principles (e.g., least action in classical mechanics and minimization of free energy in equilibrium thermodynamics).
4.1 "Biological system maximizes X": Deine the criteria to be more predictive and meaningful: Why X can't be arbitrarily large - need a theory to define physical limits to performance; measure X and compare it to the theoretical maximum; maximizing X should generate some predictions (on structure and dynamics) that can be tested in independent quantitative experiments.
