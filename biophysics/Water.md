Absence of water ends all the processes associated with the living state. It posesses unique properties essential for life. Fig. 4.1 in their book compares melting point, boiling point, and molal heat of vaporization for water and other dihydrides (H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>Se, H<sub>2</sub>Te). But for water, there is a trend for all of them to decrease with molecular weight. HF and NH<sub>3</sub> have similar behaviors too. Figure 4.2 compares such substances with the same number of electrons per molecule (or isoelectronic series). In this series (Ne, HF, H<sub>2</sub>2O, NH<sub>3</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>), water has the highest values for all three thermal properties. Table 4.1 compares Heat of vaporization (cal/gm), Specific heat capacity (cal/gm-deg), Surface tension (erg/cm<sup>2</sup>), Dielectric constant (esu), and Viscosity (millipoises) of water at various temperatures (0 to 100 degree celsius) with various liquides (e.gs, Ammonia, Methyl alcohol, Formic acid, Acelaldehyde, Pyridine, Chloroform). All values for water are much higher (only Ammonia's specific heat capacity is a bit higher). Specific heat capacity is the number of calories of heat required to raise the temperature of one g of a substance by one degree celsius. For normal life processes, a relative constant temperature is needed. The matabolic processes of life continually generate heat; but metabolizing tissues have 70-80% water with its high heat capacity. From Table 4.1, if the body were composed of an alcohol instead of water, the temperature rise would be almost double (Specific heat capacity values of 0.6 for methyl alcohol vs 1 for water). Water also has a high heat of vaporization (> 2 x vs methly alcohol; even higher vs others). A smaller amount of water can dissiplate a considerable amount of heat. Vaporization of 1g of water relieves the organism of >500 cal of heat.  2g --> 1000 cal. Sp. heat = 1 cal/gm-deg. So, for ~1 Kg  of body weight,  1 deg increase will occur with 1000 cal expenditure. However, 2g water loss (out of 1000 g) by vaporization will keep the temperature same. Other common organic liquids are at best only half as effective. *Actually, the evaporation of water is the most important physiological mechanism of heat dissipation for the human body*. Other properties are important too: Surface tension arises out of the differences in the intermolecular bonds in the interior of a liquid compared to those on the surface taht are attached on one side. Higher surface area --> more such molecules unattached. Amount of energy consumed per unit area is higher for water by  a factor of  3 to 4. High surface tension of water is vital for the formation of films of lipid and protein which comprise the cellular membranes. ** See summaries of lipids and cell structure below to understand this**.
