Absence of water ends all the processes associated with the living state. It posesses unique properties essential for life. Fig. 4.1 in their book compares melting point, boiling point, and molal heat of vaporization for water and other dihydrides (H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>Se, H<sub>2</sub>Te). But for water, there is a trend for all of them to decrease with molecular weight. HF and NH<sub>3</sub> have similar behaviors too. Figure 4.2 compares such substances with the same number of electrons per molecule (or isoelectronic series). In this series (Ne, HF, H<sub>2</sub>2O, NH<sub>3</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>), water has the highest values for all three thermal properties. Table 4.1 compares Heat of vaporization (cal/gm), Specific heat capacity (cal/gm-deg), Surface tension (erg/cm<sup>2</sup>), Dielectric constant (esu), and Viscosity (millipoises) of water at various temperatures (0 to 100 degree celsius) with various liquides (e.gs, Ammonia, Methyl alcohol, Formic acid, Acelaldehyde, Pyridine, Chloroform). All values for water are much higher (only Ammonia's specific heat capacity is a bit higher). Specific heat capacity is the number of calories of heat required to raise the temperature of one g of a substance by one degree celsius. For normal life processes, a relative constant temperature is needed. The matabolic processes of life continually generate heat; but metabolizing tissues have 70-80% water with its high heat capacity. From Table 4.1, if the body were composed of an alcohol instead of water, the temperature rise would be almost double (Specific heat capacity values of 0.6 for methyl alcohol vs 1 for water). Water also has a high heat of vaporization (> 2 x vs methly alcohol; even higher vs others). A smaller amount of water can dissiplate a considerable amount of heat. Vaporization of 1g of water relieves the organism of >500 cal of heat.  2g --> 1000 cal. Sp. heat = 1 cal/gm-deg. So, for ~1 Kg  of body weight,  1 deg increase will occur with 1000 cal expenditure. However, 2g water loss (out of 1000 g) by vaporization will keep the temperature same. Other common organic liquids are at best only half as effective. *Actually, the evaporation of water is the most important physiological mechanism of heat dissipation for the human body*. Other properties are important too: Surface tension arises out of the differences in the intermolecular bonds in the interior of a liquid compared to those on the surface taht are attached on one side. Higher surface area --> more such molecules unattached. Amount of energy consumed per unit area is higher for water by  a factor of  3 to 4. High surface tension of water is vital for the formation of films of lipid and protein which comprise the cellular membranes. ** See summaries of lipids and cell structure below to understand this**. High dielectric constant makes water a very effective solvent of ionic substances, since the strength of the ionic bonds is so greatly reduced that ionic crystals become unstable. Most biochemical reactions take place in water solution. 

I have found a few relevant articles. Here is their summary and reference to them:

Szebeni et al. (1990) explored the reason for attenuation of the ultrasound signals in noninvasive diagnosis of chronic liver disease. they collected ultrasound and histopathology data on 89 patients (33 normals and 56 with disease). Water content could not explain the attenuation of the signal seen in patients with non-bright liver, as the water content difference was non-significant. No correlation was found between liver water content and histopathology either. 

Lewis articles in the Merck online reference manual: Water accounts for 50% to 66% of a person's weight. Fat tissue (vs lean tissue) has less water. Women have more fat - so the % of water in women is lower (52 to 55%) vs men (60%). TBW is also lower in older and obese people, higher (70%) at birth and early childhood. *A 154 pound (70 Kg) man has 10.5 gallons (42 liters) of water - 7 gallons (28 liters) intracellular, 2.5 gallons (10.5 liters) in extracellular spaces, and 1 gallon (3.5 liters) in the blood*. Healthy adults sshould drink 2 quarts (2 liters) of fluids per day. body is good at excreting excess water drank, but not at conserving water in case of limited intake. Water is primarily absorbed from the GI tract (also obtained from metabolic activities). Depending upon the body's needs, the Kidneys (the primary source of water removal) may excrete a pint or several gallons of urine per day. Profus sweating can significantly increase water loss through evaporation. The body works to keep the total amount of water and electrolyte levels constant. When the body is low in water, the *pituitary gland* secretes vasopressin (ADH) which stimulates the kidneys to conserve water and excrete less urine. Intracellular K and Na concns: 140 and 12 mEq/L, respectively. Extracellular: 3.5 to 5 and 140 mEq/L, respectively. *Osmotic forces*: The concentration of combined solutes in water is osmalarity (amount of solute per L of solution). Osmalality (amount of solute per Kg of solution) in units of mOsm/Kg is given as 2 * serum Na (in mEq/L) + 1/18 * Glucose (in mg/dL) + 1/2.8 * BUN (in mg/dL). Normal value: 275 to 290 mOsm/Kg. High Na (viz., salty food), high glucose (in diabetes), and high BUN (in kidney disease) increase osmalality.  Other osmatically active substances are alcohols, mannitol, and glycine. Water (not solutes) crosses cell membranes freely to equalize osmalality. Solutes that diffuse freely across the membrane (such as urea) have no osmotic activity. Na/K have restricted movement and contribute heavily to osmotic activity. Osmotic force can be opposed by other forces: plasma proteins have a small osmotic effect that tends to draw water into the plasma. Vascular hydrostatic forces force water out of the plasma. *There is twice as much water inside cells*. Water loss per day (in a 70 Kg person): 1.5 L from urine; 0.75 L from lungs and skin; with fever, 0.06 L/degree C increase. An increase of just 2% in plama osmalality can trigger thirst from hypothalamus.  

Basile et al., (2008) compared TBW estimated by two anthropometric equations (by Watson and Hume) with TBW obtained by BIA in 3625 normal caucasian men and women (1860 M and 1765 W) and 688 hemodialysis patients (443 M and 245 W). BIA used ) 0.8 mA, 50-KHz four electrode method. Pairs were matched for age, body weight, and height, and gender. TBW was the same amongst each of the genders (no difference for diseased vs normal subjects). However, *R* from BIA was statistically different. See table below:
| Group  | Gender   |  Mean(in Ω)   | SD (in Ω)    | Significance
-----------------------------------------------------------------
| Disease| Male | 558 |80 | *P* <0.0001 for men
| Normal | Male | 511| 58 |
|Disease | Female| 615|100| *P* < 0.02 for women
| Normal | Female| 593| 70|

Lipids:

Cell Structure: Consider a hypothetical cell of spherical shape with a radius of 20 μ. Volume of the cell = 4/3π r<sup>3</sup> = 3.4 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>. Surface area = 4πr<sup>2</sup> = 5 x 10<sup>-5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>. This cell is approximately 80% water. Of the remaining material, about 70% is protein. Consider this in terms of the number of molecules involved. A Kg of cells would contain 800 g of water, or 44.4 moles (molecular weight of water = 18 g/mole). Say proteins had a mean molecular weight of 500. there would be 200 g/500 g = 0.4 mole. Hence each mole of protein within the cell is in the vicinity of 44.4 moles/0.4 mole or 111 molecules of water. Cellular activities can thus be understood only in terms of an appreciation of water structure and function. Various cells can produce > 750 enzymes (The number in 1965). These enzymes catalyze metabolic events involving thousands of organic compounds. These events typically occur under constant temperature and pressure. ... More later
