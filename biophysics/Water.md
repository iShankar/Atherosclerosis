From "Biophysical Principles of Structure and Function", by Snell et al., Addison-Wesley, 1965.

**Water**: Absence of water ends all the processes associated with the living state. It posesses unique properties essential for life. Fig. 4.1 in their book compares melting point, boiling point, and molal heat of vaporization for water and other dihydrides (H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>Se, H<sub>2</sub>Te). But for water, there is a trend for all of them to decrease with molecular weight. HF and NH<sub>3</sub> have similar behaviors too. Figure 4.2 compares such substances with the same number of electrons per molecule (or isoelectronic series). In this series (Ne, HF, H<sub>2</sub>2O, NH<sub>3</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>), water has the highest values for all three thermal properties. Table 4.1 compares Heat of vaporization (cal/gm), Specific heat capacity (cal/gm-deg), Surface tension (erg/cm<sup>2</sup>), Dielectric constant (esu), and Viscosity (millipoises) of water at various temperatures (0 to 100 degree celsius) with various liquides (e.gs, Ammonia, Methyl alcohol, Formic acid, Acelaldehyde, Pyridine, Chloroform). All values for water are much higher (only Ammonia's specific heat capacity is a bit higher). Specific heat capacity is the number of calories of heat required to raise the temperature of one g of a substance by one degree celsius. For normal life processes, a relative constant temperature is needed. The matabolic processes of life continually generate heat; but metabolizing tissues have 70-80% water with its high heat capacity. From Table 4.1, if the body were composed of an alcohol instead of water, the temperature rise would be almost double (Specific heat capacity values of 0.6 for methyl alcohol vs 1 for water). Water also has a high heat of vaporization (> 2 x vs methly alcohol; even higher vs others). A smaller amount of water can dissiplate a considerable amount of heat. Vaporization of 1g of water relieves the organism of >500 cal of heat.  2g --> 1000 cal. Sp. heat = 1 cal/gm-deg. So, for ~1 Kg  of body weight,  1 deg increase will occur with 1000 cal expenditure. However, 2g water loss (out of 1000 g) by vaporization will keep the temperature same. Other common organic liquids are at best only half as effective. *Actually, the evaporation of water is the most important physiological mechanism of heat dissipation for the human body*. Other properties are important too: Surface tension arises out of the differences in the intermolecular bonds in the interior of a liquid compared to those on the surface taht are attached on one side. Higher surface area --> more such molecules unattached. Amount of energy consumed per unit area is higher for water by  a factor of  3 to 4. High surface tension of water is vital for the formation of films of lipid and protein which comprise the cellular membranes. ** See summaries of lipids and cell structure below to understand this**. High dielectric constant makes water a very effective solvent of ionic substances, since the strength of the ionic bonds is so greatly reduced that ionic crystals become unstable. Most biochemical reactions take place in water solution. 

Physical properties of various liquids:

|             |cal/gm        | cal/gm-deg| erg/cm* cm   | esu           | millipoises|
|-------------|:-------------|:----------|:-------------|:--------------|:-----------|
|Water, 0 C   | 596          | 1.009     | 75.64        |  88           | 17.92      |

**Polysaccharides**:

**Lipids**:

**Cell Structure**: Consider a hypothetical cell of spherical shape with a radius of 20 μ. Volume of the cell = 4/3π r3 = 3.4 x 10-8 cm3. Surface area = 4πr2 = 5 x 10-5 cm2. This cell is approximately 80% water. Of the remaining material, about 70% is protein. Consider this in terms of the number of molecules involved. A Kg of cells would contain 800 g of water, or 44.4 moles (molecular weight of water = 18 g/mole). Say proteins had a mean molecular weight of 500. there would be 200 g/500 g = 0.4 mole. Hence each mole of protein within the cell is in the vicinity of 44.4 moles/0.4 mole or 111 molecules of water. Cellular activities can thus be understood only in terms of an appreciation of water structure and function. Various cells can produce > 750 enzymes (The number in 1965). These enzymes catalyze metabolic events involving thousands of organic compounds. These events typically occur under constant temperature and pressure.  Cells differ significantly in their composition (egs: lipid engorged adipose cells and protein-rich secretary cells of the alimentary mucosa; length to width may be 1:1 vs 100:1 in neural cells). But there is much commonality. The non-aqueous parts (20% of wet weight): 14% protein, 2% lipids, 2% RNA, 1% DNA, and 1% polysaccharide. The average membrane is 10 nm arranged as a sandwitch with 2.5 nm protein layers on both sides and an intermediate bimolecular lipid layer (7 nm). The hydrophilic portion of the lipids face the protein, while the hydrocarbon tails are close to each other. It has a potential difference of 40 mV and thus, an E value of 4 x 10<sup>6</sup> volts/cm. C is about 1 µF/cm<sup>2</sup>, and R is 1000 Ω/cm<sup>2</sup>. The dielectric constant is 11, much below that of water 

I have found a few relevant articles. Here is their summary and reference to them:

Szebeni et al. (1990) explored the reason for attenuation of the ultrasound signals in noninvasive diagnosis of chronic liver disease. they collected ultrasound and histopathology data on 89 patients (33 normals and 56 with disease). Water content could not explain the attenuation of the signal seen in patients with non-bright liver, as the water content difference was non-significant. No correlation was found between liver water content and histopathology either. 

Lewis articles in the Merck online reference manual: Water accounts for 50% to 66% of a person's weight. Fat tissue (vs lean tissue) has less water. Women have more fat - so the % of water in women is lower (52 to 55%) vs men (60%). TBW is also lower in older and obese people, higher (70%) at birth and early childhood. *A 154 pound (70 Kg) man has 10.5 gallons (42 liters) of water - 7 gallons (28 liters) intracellular, 2.5 gallons (10.5 liters) in extracellular spaces, and 1 gallon (3.5 liters) in the blood*. Healthy adults sshould drink 2 quarts (2 liters) of fluids per day. body is good at excreting excess water drank, but not at conserving water in case of limited intake. Water is primarily absorbed from the GI tract (also obtained from metabolic activities). Depending upon the body's needs, the Kidneys (the primary source of water removal) may excrete a pint or several gallons of urine per day. Profus sweating can significantly increase water loss through evaporation. The body works to keep the total amount of water and electrolyte levels constant. When the body is low in water, the *pituitary gland* secretes vasopressin (ADH) which stimulates the kidneys to conserve water and excrete less urine. Intracellular K and Na concns: 140 and 12 mEq/L, respectively. Extracellular: 3.5 to 5 and 140 mEq/L, respectively. *Osmotic forces*: The concentration of combined solutes in water is osmalarity (amount of solute per L of solution). Osmalality (amount of solute per Kg of solution) in units of mOsm/Kg is given as 2 * serum Na (in mEq/L) + 1/18 * Glucose (in mg/dL) + 1/2.8 * BUN (in mg/dL). Normal value: 275 to 290 mOsm/Kg. High Na (viz., salty food), high glucose (in diabetes), and high BUN (in kidney disease) increase osmalality.  Other osmatically active substances are alcohols, mannitol, and glycine. Water (not solutes) crosses cell membranes freely to equalize osmalality. Solutes that diffuse freely across the membrane (such as urea) have no osmotic activity. Na/K have restricted movement and contribute heavily to osmotic activity. Osmotic force can be opposed by other forces: plasma proteins have a small osmotic effect that tends to draw water into the plasma. Vascular hydrostatic forces force water out of the plasma. *There is twice as much water inside cells*. Water loss per day (in a 70 Kg person): 1.5 L from urine; 0.75 L from lungs and skin; with fever, 0.06 L/degree C increase. An increase of just 2% in plama osmalality can trigger thirst from hypothalamus.  

Basile et al., (2008) compared TBW estimated by two anthropometric equations (by Watson and Hume) with TBW obtained by BIA in 3625 normal caucasian men and women (1860 M and 1765 W) and 688 hemodialysis patients (443 M and 245 W). BIA used ) 0.8 mA, 50-KHz four electrode method. Pairs were matched for age, body weight, and height, and gender. TBW was the same amongst each of the genders (no difference for diseased vs normal subjects), when measured by anthropometic methods (obvious, but not elucidated by others in the past). This highlights the failure of such methods to estimate TBW. However, *R* from BIA was statistically different, showing that TBW is better measured with BIA. See table below:


| Group  | Gender   | Mean (in Ω) | SD (in Ω) | Significance  |
|--------|:---------|:-----------|:----------|:--------------|
| Disease| Male | 558 |80 | *P* <0.0001 for men|
| Normal | Male | 511| 58 | |
|Disease | Female| 615|100| *P* < 0.02 for women|
| Normal | Female| 593| 70|  |

The authors indicate that the BIA method has been well validated against meansurement of body fluid volume through isotome dilution in non-uraemic subjects. They use a BIA equation developed by Sun et al that uses gender, body weight and height, as the anthropometric equations do, but with the addition of *R*. 

Rosner and Gore (2001) discuss the errors involved in estimating the nutrient intake through FFQ (food frequency quetionnaire) or 24-hour recall. Weighted diet records  provide accurate assessments. They suggest the use of a validation study on a subset of individuals to ascertain the relation between the two methods. They also model disease incidence as a function of estimated diet record food (and nutrient) intake and apply prospectively these methods to breast cancer data from the Nurse's Health Study. They related breast cancer incidence from 1980 to 1994 to estimated sucrose and alcohol intake in 1980. Surcose intake is inversely associated with alcohol intake and alcohol is an established positive risk factor for breast cancer. OR for alcohol was 1.2+ (Quintile 5 vs Quintile 1, based on alcohol intake). 

Chan et al., (2002) considered whole blood η, plasma η, Hct, and Fibronogen as independent risk factors for CHD, which can be elevated by dehydration. Study group: 8,280 M and 12,017 W, ages 38-100 who were without heart disease, stroke, or diabetes at baseline in 1976. A total of 246 fatal CHD events occurred during the 6-year follow-up. High daily intakes of water (5 or more glasses) compared to low (<= 2 glasses) had a relative risk in men of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.75, *P* < 0.001), and in women of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.97). A high versus low intake of fluids other than water was associated with a relative risk of 2.47 (95% CI: 1.04, 5.88) in women and of 1.46 (95% CI: 0.7, 3.03) in men.  Adjustments for age, smoking, HT, BMI, education, and (in women) HRT, did not impact these results. Compared to the general population, this population drank more water, milk, and fruit juices and less coffee, tea, and carbonated and alcoholic beverages. They quote references that suggest that **blood η** is adversely affected by hypohydration and these rheologic factors  (η and Fibrinogen) predict the risk of CHD. The difference in blood η, although statistically significant, are only 2 to 7%. These are the range of change seen in mild, nonclinical hypohydration. The small elevation in blood η in the morning might be behind increased CHD then. Rationale behind other fluids' risk increase: Caffeine is a mild diuretic, increasing η. Juices and sodas have osmalalities of 556 to 836 mOsm/kg. This causes a net movement of fluid from the vascular system to the intestinal lumen, leading to increase in blood η. Serum TGL (triglyceride) is raised by sugary drinks. TGL increase after 2.7 glasses (640 ml) of grape juice and 3 glasses of OJ (750 ml) were 50% and 30% respectively. Even high normal TGL is a CHD  and thrombosis risk factor. *Men vs Women: Women have lower η due to lower Hct, RBC rigidity, and aggregability at all shear rates*.  

Impact on Alzheimer's disease: Dumont et al., (2017) and Ji et al., (2018) discuss this. Neuroinflammation impacts many neurological diseases including AD. Free water (FW) in (normal appearing) white matter (called relative FW or rFW here) , obtained from MRI imaging, was higher for subjects with greater cognitive impairments. MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and AD patients both had statistically significant high values relative to NC (normal controls), but not significantly different from each other. Pasernak et al., (2018) compared AD, amnestic MCI (aMCI) with healthy controls (NC). n = 39, 41, and 39, respectively. aMCI had widespread FW increases vs NC. FW was further increased in AD vs aMCI. FA<sub>t</sub> (fractional anisotropy) was reduced only in certain regions for aMCI, but was far more widespread for AD.
