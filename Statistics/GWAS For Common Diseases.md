Summary of recent papers on GWAS and Exome Sequencing for common diseases and Complex Traits:

Hirschhorn and Daly's paper was written when GWAS became feasible due to lowering cost and acceptance by funding agencies. A dense set of SNPs across the genome is genotyped to survey the most common genetic variation for a role in disease or to identify the heritable Quantitative Traits taht are risk factors for disease. A well-powered study was yet to be published at that time. The paper considered rationale for GWAS and issues of their power, efficiency, comprehensiveness, interpretation, and analysis. Two feasible study categories are: candidate-gene studies, which use either association or resequencing approaches, and genome wide studies, which include both linkage mapping and GWAS. 

Linkage studies have been highly successful for finding genes for monogenic 'Mendeilian' diseases. Variants that cause monogenic disorders are rare (due to negative selection), so each segregating disease allele will be found in the same 10-20 cM chromosomal background within each family. These are highly penetrant variants; thus markers within 10-20 cM of the disease-causing alleles will co-segregate with diseaase status.  Genome-wide linkage analysis has also been carried out for common diseases, where the high penetrance of Mendelian diseases may not apply (exceptions: IBD, schizophrenia and T1D - even for these exceptions, only a small portion of the heritability is explained).   


Definitions/Elaborations:

* [CM](https://isogg.org/wiki/CentiMorgan): CentiMorgan estimates a chromosomal regiion's to propensity to recombine, as determined from parent-siblings studies.  One centiMorgan = ~ 1 Mbp. 1 CM = 1% chance that a marker at one genetic locus on a chromosome will be separated from a marker at a second locus due to crossing over in a single generation. An analogy: if the terrain is hilly, 1 mile (similar to 1 Mbp)  might feel like 2 miles. Thus cM captures the probability of similarity of the 'terrain'. If two cousins share 40 cM on chromosome 1 (approximately 40 Mbp in length), they can be predicted to share a certain degree of relationship statistically (there is an average 30% chance of crossover for 40 cM). 
* Genetic Marker: It can be a SNP or as long as a minisatellite. A minisatellite is a tract of repetitive DNA in which certain DNA motifs (10â€“60 base pairs) are typically repeated 5-50 times. They occur at ~ 1,000 locations in the human genome,  are subject to high mutation  and have a high diversity in the population. They are prominent in the centromeres and telomeres. The name "satellite" comes from the fact that they cause a separate layer during centrifuging. They are also called VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats). Microsatellites are referred to as short tandem repeats (STRs) or simple sequence repeats (SSRs). 
* [Human Genome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome): As an example of the details, Chr 1 is 8.5 cm long with 248956422 bps (~249 Mpb). The length of a bp is 340 pm (~250 M x 340 p = 0.25 x 0.34 m = 2.5 x 3.4 cm = 8.5 cm). It has 12 M variations (genetic markers of 1+ length), 2058 protein coding genes, 1220 psedogenes, 1200 long ncRNA, and 496 small ncRNA. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are  > 200b with no protein-coding potential. These incluce rRNA (ribosomal) and other long RNAs involved in gene expression regulation and epigenetic modifications of DNA nucleotides and histone proteins. Small ncRNA are <200b and include miRNA (micro) and snoRNA (Small nucleolar).
* [Protein-coding genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome): The median size of a protein-coding gene is 26,288 bp (mean = 66,577 bp). The median size of an exon is 122 bp (mean = 145 bp), the median number of exons is 7 (mean = 8.8), and the median coding sequence encodes 367 amino acids (mean = 447 amino acids).
