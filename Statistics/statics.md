This is a set of notes for quick response of the various related concepts. Fletcher et al. (1988) is a well written book that describes these concepts in a simple-to-understand style.

From a 2 x 2 table of Test Vs Disease, Se or Sn - Sensitivity ( or True Positive Rate) = TP/ (TP+FN); (1 -Specificity) is the False Positive Rate, where Sp (specificity) = TN/ (TN + FP). Hence False Positive Rate = FP/(TN + FP). For diabetes, a blood sugar level of >180 mg% would be highly specific and a level > 70 mg% would be highly sensitive. Goal is to find the appropriate cutoff with good Sn and Sp. *My interpretation: Poor Sn can kill; poor Sp can upset the pt*. High Sn is good for mass scrrening and for initial screening of a diagnostic workup (when a great many possibilities are being considered). It is most useful when the test result is negavie. High Sp is used to 'rule-in' a diagnosis taht has been suggested by other data. It is most useful when the test result is positive. One would perform a tissue assay with high Sp before starting cancer therapy to avoid the harm of unnecessary physical, emotional, or financial consequences. 

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) plots Sn on the Y-axis and (1-Sp) on the x-axis for various cutoff points. The diagonal line is equivalent to coin toss or pure chance. So, good ROC curves would cluster around the top left side of the plot, corresponding to high values of Sn and Sp. Figure 3.6 in their book shows ROC curves for four stages of colorectal cancer for a diagnostic blood test of CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen), for the same set of cutoff points. Stage A is close to the diagonal, while for Stage D it approaches the idear ROC, where the prevalence within the group is much higher. Thus, the patient group studied (i.e., the disease prevalence in the studied group) is important. Conclusion: CEA performs well for metastatic disease and poorly for localized cancer. 

The Precision of Sn and Sp is defined as the 95% CI (confidence interval); it is improved as N increases. The probability of the disease, given the results of a test, is called the predictive value of the test. PPV, or Positive predictive value (TP / (TP + FP)), is the probability of disease in a patient with a positive (abnormal) test result; NPV, Negative predictive value (TN/ (TN + FN)), is the probability of not having the disease when the test result is negative (normal). Accuracy is the proportion of all test results, both positive and negative, that are correct. Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN). *Accuracy is not very useful for a clinician*. Prevalence = (TP + FP) / (TP + FP + FN + FN). 

Tests that have both high Sn and Sp are rare; Clinicians must use other means for circumventing the trade-off bewtween Sn and Sp. A common way is to use the results of several tests together. High Sn also implies high NPV, that is, the clinician can be more confident that the pt does not have the disease; Conversely, high Sp imples high PPV. However, PPV and NPV are influenced by prevalence, which means it is not independent of the setting in which the test is used. Positive results even for test with high Sp, when applied to pateints with a low likelihood of disease presence, will be largely FP. Similarly negative results even for tests with high Sn, when applied to patients having a high chance of having the disease, will be largely FN. *In summary, the interpretation of a positive or negative diagnostic test result should vary based on the estimated prevalence of disease in the particular setting*. More: Imagine a population in which no one has the disease. In such a group, even for a high Sp test, all positive results will be FP. *Thus, as the prevalence of disease in a population approaches zero, PPV of a test also approaches zero*. *Similarly, as prevalence approaches 100%, NPV value approaches zero*. Since, by definition, with even with high Sn all negatives will be FNs. *Put my way, Sn (and NPV) is for early screening where presumed prevalence is low,  and Sp (and PPV) is for final confirmation where presumed prevalence is high*. A Stress ECG is less useful in diagnosing CAD in a 30 year old woman as compared to a 65 year old man; Similarly a sickle test has a higher PPV among African Americans as compared to White Americans. 

Some notes: University hospitals are likely to have high prevalence populations and PPV/NPV obtained are probably not pertinent to general population. Also, for case-control studies, the N for both groups is about the same, thus leading to a prevalence of 50% with the PPV falsely elevated. 

Corrrect set up, if prevalence is 10%:

Diagnostic Test   |  Disease Present   | Disease Absent
------------------|--------------------|---------------
Positive          |     27             | 350
Negative          |     10             | 770
