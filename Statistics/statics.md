This is a set of notes for quick response of the various related concepts. Fletcher et al. (1988) is a well written book that describes these concepts in a simple-to-understand style.

From a 2 x 2 table of Test Vs Disease, Se or Sn - Sensitivity ( or True Positive Rate) = TP/ (TP+FN); (1 -Specificity) is the False Positive Rate, where Sp (specificity) = TN/ (TN + FP). Hence False Positive Rate = FP/(TN + FP). For diabetes, a blood sugar level of >180 mg% would be highly specific and a level > 70 mg% would be highly sensitive. Goal is to find the appropriate cutoff with good Sn and Sp. *My interpretation: Poor Sn can kill; poor Sp can upset the pt*

ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) plots Sn on the Y-axis and (1-Sp) on the x-axis for various cutoff points. The diagonal line is equivalent to coin toss or pure chance. So, good ROC curves would cluster around the top left side of the plot, corresponding to high values of Sn and Sp. Figure 3.6 in their book shows ROC curves for four stages of colorectal cancer for a diagnostic blood test of CEA (Carcinoembryonic antigen), for the same set of cutoff points. Stage A is close to the diagonal, while for Stage D it approaches the idear ROC, where the prevalence within the group is much higher. Thus, the patient group studied (i.e., the disease prevalence in the studied group) is important. Conclusion: CEA performs well for metastatic disease and poorly for localized cancer. 

The Precision of Sn and Sp is defined as the 95% CI (confidence interval); it is improved as N increases. The probability of the disease, given the results of a test, is called the predictive value of the test. Positive predictive value (TP / (TP + FP)) is the probability of disease in a patient with a positive (abnormal) test result; Negative predictive value (TN/ (TN + FN)) is the probability ofnot having the disease when the test result is negative (normal). 

Tests that have both high Sn and Sp are rare; Clinicians must use other means for circumventing the trade-off bewtween Sn and Sp. A common way is to use the results of several tests together.
