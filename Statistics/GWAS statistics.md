Statistical Power: Say a coin is tossed 1000 times. How to tell whether it is biased? An unbiased coin will give this power curve (see Ref 1):

With one thousand flips, one can easily see if the coin is biased to give heads 60% of the time. One could not flip a fair coin 1,000 times and get more than 600 heads. Scientists typically use a statistical power of 0.8, corresponding to an 80% chance of concluding there’s a real effect. In other words, studies should have no more than a 20% probability of making a Type II error. This represents a reasonable balance between alpha and beta risk. Type I errors are typically viewed as four times more serious than Type II errors. Thus, if alpha significance levels are set at .05, then beta levels should be set at .20 and power (which = 1 – β) should be .80.  [Ref](https://effectsizefaq.com/2010/05/31/what-is-an-ideal-level-of-statistical-power/). Say, we need to find the minimum sample size required to give us a reasonable chance (.80) of detecting an effect of certain size given a conventional level of alpha (.05). One can use a power table or use a power calculator. One is mentioned [here](https://effectsizefaq.com/2010/05/31/can-you-recommend-a-good-power-calculator/).
