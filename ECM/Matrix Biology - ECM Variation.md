Summary of Chapter 3: "Matrix Biology: ECM Turnover and Temporal Fluctuation" by Tran, Q., and Ogle, B.M.. 

ECM Dynamics in the myocardium: Heart tube is generated first, with an inner endothelial layer and an outer muscular layer. next, a looping process that forms the atrial and ventricular portions and then chambers. The myocardium is distinguished as epi, myo, and endo regions. Cardiomyocytes migrate, proliferate, differentiate, and organize to generate a highly structured myocardium that can generate physical and electrical impulses. Cells fro the preepicardial organ migrate and generate the embryonic epicardium. They transition to mesenchymal cells, migrate to myocardium, and differentiate into cardiac fibroblasts. They are the main source of ECM and contribute to mechanical, biochemical, structural, and electrical activities of the heart. Epicardial cells also differentiate into vascular SMC and endothelial cells of the heart, especially within the coronary vascular network. *Myocardiogenesis*: The myocardium is mechanically stimulated with each heart beat. Myocardium must be *strong enough to sustain tensile load and elastic enough to recoil following extension*. This is achieved (in part) with ECM - it has fibrillar collagens (types I, III, V, and XI) and proteins associated with elastic fibers. **Collagen is the most abundant ECM within the body** and plays a major role in the tensile strength of tissues. Collegen proteins composed of triple helices with high concentration of *glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), and hydroxyproline* AAs that self-organize into fibrils and fibers. Hydroxyproline is formed by **hydroxylation** of proline as a post-translational modification. It is 4% of all AAs found in animal tissue, at higher amount than 7 AAs translationally formed. Collagen is generically shown as X-Y-Gly AA triad. A Pro in the Y position is hydroxylated (Hyp) which increases the stability of the collagen triple helix. This increase in stability is not due to water molecules, but is explained based on stereoelectronic effects. *Hydration provides little or no additional stability. Elastin also has collagen-like domains with Hyp*.  Collagen I is evident in the epicardium of the mouse by 2d (after birth). Collagen III null mice have reduced number of Collagen I fibrils. Elastic fibers enable heart recoil. Elastin is the primary component of the elastic fiber and is rich in hydrophobic AAs, which tend to aggregate until tension is applied. *Elastin fibers* comprise of crosslinked elastin molecules and microfibril containing *glycoproteins such as fibrillins and fibulins*. Elastin expression peaks at 16.5 ED (*embryonic day*, in mice) and in the epicardium 2d after birth. Fibrillin-1 is detected at ED 10.5, spcifically with endothelial and epithelial cells (...). Increase in elastin at mid-late gestation is thought to be in support of heart recoil. Soon after birth, there is a relative decrease in elastin. *MCP* (multicellular proteins) are non-structural proteins tha contain binding sites for structural ECM proteins, cell surface receptors, and growth factors. Thrombospondin, an MCP, has three identical subunits linked through disulfide bonds. Fibronectin, another MCP, peaks early (ED 11) and has roles in cell migration and collagen I fibril organization. *Proteoglycans* are ECM proteins with a core protein with 1+ GAGs attached. They interact with other PGs, GAGs, ECM proteins, **cations (sodium and potassium), and water** and generally serve to lubricate the extracellular space. Versican, a PG with CS, is involved in trabeculae formation in the myocardium, along with modulation from fibulin-1, ADAMTS-1 and 9. *GAGs* are polysacch chains, found in association with proteins or free floating. GAGs affect cell behavior through interaction with GFs, enzymes, cytokines present in EC space. *HA* is an anionic, non-sulfated GAG. (Some general info:  distributed throughout connective, epithelial, and neural tissues; its' MW can reach into millions. An avearge person (70Kg) has 15 g of HA and 1/3rd is tuned over every day. it is a polymer of disacchs, composed of D-glucuronic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, linked via alternating β-(1→4) and β-(1→3) glycosidic bonds. Can have 25 K repeats, with molecular weights of 5 K to 20 M Da). During mouse cardiac development HA is found in the interstitial space near cardiomycytes. Has-2 (*HA synthase-2*) is seen in the myocardium and endocardium at ED 8.5. Has-2 null mice are devoid of trabeculae. Also, rat embryos cultured in *hyaluronidase* have poorer ventricular function.
