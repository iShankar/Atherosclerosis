This summarizes the book: "Mimicking the Extracellular Matrix: The Intersection of Matrix Biology and Biomaterials", edited by G.A. Hudalla and W.L. Murphy, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2013. As the title imples, there are several chapters on matrix biology and several more on biomaterials which attempt to mimic biological matrix properties. Relative to the earlier biophysics references cited in another folder here, there is a clear effort here to include polysaccharides as a building block ('polymer'). I have also read recently several books on Hyaluronan; the coverage there shows a peaking of interest in 1980s and continuing through to 2000s.  This more current collection shows that indeed those concepts have found main-stream support in biomaterial synthesis. However, the current genomic analysis  to understand better heritable risks of complex diseases seems to ignore such biophysical and systems aspects. My attempt here is to summarize such knowledge in related fields and inquire how to incorporate them in genomic analysis to further the heritability linkage.
