Chapter 1, by Sandell, L.J., in "Mimicking E..C..M". Title: Matrix Biology: ECM -Building function through complexity
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the extracellular component that provides structural and biochemical support to nearby cells. It involves the interaction of large and small molecules, is tissue specific, dynamic, changing during development, injury, or disease. It functions to control many *critical parameters of tissue homeostasis and response* such as proliferation, apoptosis, development, and morphogenesis. 

It is a storage for functional molecules (for structural, signaling, and degradation) released later (eg. GF - growth factors that bind to GAGs of proteoglycans such as fibroblast growth factor - FGF). ECM has a genetically distinct collagen, and in combination with other molecules (elastin for skin, aggrecan for cartilage). Highly functional ECM has a low cell to matrix ratio. ECM can resist compression (cartilage), make strong attachments (tendon, ligament), ... , and guide nerve and blood vessels. *Water* is a critical commponent of ECM. It determines tissue volume, space for molecular transport, and offers compressive resistance. Water content, extrafibrillar, is determined by the concentration of proteoglycans and glycoproteins. Hydrodynamic processes involved: osmosis, filtration, swelling, and diffusion. Nonlinear transfer functions (the author calls it 'nonideal') influence these processes and in dynamic events such as viscous dissipation of water over the surface of the polymer chain. 

ECM components: 
* Collagen - the most abundant protein in all multicellular organisms, comes in 28 different forms, with 46 genetically distinct polmer chains (Type1 in skin and bone; Type III in tendon, blood vessels and intestine, Type II in cartilage and vitreous, Type V in cornea and dermis, Type IV in basement membrane, type XIII in endothelial cells and heart). The most abundant ones (types I, II, and III) are 3000 nm long and is made up of uninterrupted *Gly-X (proline)-Y (hydroxy prline)* repeats. Type IV is the same length, but has interruptions of this Gly-X-Y sequence. Three polypeptide chains from a single/multiple genes form a collagen molecule (as a right-handed triple helix). Each protein has functional subdivisions  involved in biosynthesis, fibrillogensis, cross-linking, cell interactions, and degradation. Evolutionarily, collagen arose from a single 54 bp exon encoding 18 AAs that form 6 Gly-X-Y triplets. This exon is duplicated many times to form the fibrillar collagen. Domains were added to support secretion, molecular interactions, and degradation. Promoter and other regulatory elements allow specific genes to be expressed in different tissues. 
* Large Chrondoitin Sulfate Proteoglycans: They have a protein backbone and attached GAG chains. Aggrecan, the major proteoglycan of cartilage, provides for compressibility in cartilgage (smaller amounts in meniscus and tendon). Aggrecan has several chrondoitin sulfate and keratan sulfate side chains, contained in the C-terminal two-thirds of the core protein, while the N-terminal one-third has N-linked carbs and behaves like a globular protein (M= 60K D). This globlular side has affinity for HA (hyaluronan). Many such monomers aggregate bound to a central HA strand. This aggregate is stabilized by a link glycoprotein. Each aggrecan has a MW of 300 KD, with over 100 GAG side chains. This "monomer" attaches via the link protein to HA, making the entire complex > 1M KD. Large proteoglycans have been described in other areas, such as aorta smooth muscles. Aggrecan has three globular domains (G1, G2, G3). *Globular proteins are spherical, common, and more water soluble vs fibrous or membrane proteins*. It has two exons for 30 KS (Keratan sulfate) and **100** CS (Chondroitin sulfate) chain attachment. Other large proteoglycans are versican, neurocan, and brevican. 
* Small Proteoglycans: Either small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) with CS or DS (Dermatan sulfate) side chains or the syndecan with a HS side chain. **SLRP has hydrodynamic and structural roles**, ECM organization, fibrillogenesis and signal transduction, particularly during development, pathophysiology, and tumor growth. *High degree of myopia is associated with intronic variations and SNPs in fibromodulin, proline/arginine-rich and leucine-rich repeat protein (PRELP) and opticin genes*. 

Biosynthesis of ECM macromolecules: ... The secretory machinery of a connective tissue cell is specialized for a high rate of synthesis of specific ECM molecules and their secretion. **High degree of collagen synthesis during organogenesis and repair leads to high levels of collagen propeptides in serum and urine - can be used as biomarkers of synthesis**. Propeptides help in the alignment of three helix chains. After collagen fibrils are formed, intermolecular cross-links are formed between hydroxylated lysine residues, forming an aldehyde. Complex cross-links are formed in collagen and elasin, and they confer physical and mechanical properties of the fibrils and provide the tensile strength fundamental to the structural role of collagen fibers in connective tissues. The enzyme lysyl oxidase and copper are required to form cross-links. Deficiency in either lead to lathyrism (*poor bone formation and strength, hyperextensible skin, and increased aortic aneurysms*). 

Other Matrix Molecules:
* Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans: They play key roles during normal development, tissue morphogenesis, and wound healing. They also participate in selective filtration of biological fluids, cellular barriers, and in modulation of angiogenesis. 
* Matricellular Proteins: These modulate cell-matrix ineractions and cell functions, but do not have a structural role. 
* Elastic Tissues: They allow for *repetitive distending/relaxing or passive lengthening/shortening movements endowing the tissues with flexibility and rubber-like extensibility*. Elastic fibers occurs as concentric sheets or lamellae in blood vessels. Elastic tissues have elastin predominantly, along with fibrillin and a smaller glycoprotein, microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP). A single gene encodes elastin, with alternatively spliced products; Fibrillin is encoded by two genes. *Elastic fibers are extremely inert and difficult to extract from ECM*. MMP-12 is the elastase isolated from macrophages.
